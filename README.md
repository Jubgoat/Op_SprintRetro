# Op_SprintRetro
Sprint retrospective from the class Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a video game software company that had asked us to develop an app for them called 'Draw it or lose it' in which two users competed
by drawing various objects and guessing them. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think the part that I did the best on was the evaluation section of the document in which I evaluated the benefits and disadvantages of the four main
operating platforms, Mac, Windows, Linux, and Mobile. The organization and the brief but detailed descriptions I thought I did particularly well on this section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think the part that I thought was the most helpful was the UML design, it helped to see a visualization of where the program was going and what was going to be inherited from 
one class to another. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the executive summary could have been a bit more descriptive and that it could have explained more about what the game was about and what was going on in the document.
To eleviate this in the future I would update the summary as the other sections got completed. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I developed little by little and tested each instance once it was completed, while hopefully getting feedback from the user. If we did not consider the 
customer's needs then we wouldn't know what problems there might be and the program would not be popular if it did not cater to the needs of it's customer base, 
it would also make it seem as though the company was out of touch.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The documentation helped organize my thoughts and let me focus on what was important. The other helpful thing like I said before was the UML design as it 
helped provide a visual representation to the process and what the class behavior was going to follow.
